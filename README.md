<br><br>
This repository provides a way for you to solve the Google ReCaptcha V2 using Yolov5 Object Detection.

## How to Use
- Clone the repo into your local machine.
- Download the finetuned yolov5 checkpoint from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14rpkowFJhEmF7-U22yCXIsVC_O7-DVFt/view?usp=share_link).
- Install the dependices by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal of the directory of the project.
- Watch the tutorial on how to use the recaptcha solve on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/7_2hyMKQVkA)

I have added an **example.py** file in the repo that use the model to solve the recaptcha on [Google ReCaptcha Demo](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo).
To run that you must first install:
1. Google Chrome/[Google Chrome Beta](https://www.google.com/intl/en_pk/chrome/beta/) (recommended) 
2. [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). Note: You must downlaod the chromedriver for the version of chrome/chrome beta you installed.<br>
You can now run the example.py file to see the bot in action after following all the steps on how to use.

## Dataset
I manually curated a dataset for finetuning yolov5 which was a very tedious work. I needed to label objects in images etc. If you need access to the dataset and notebooks used to finetune yolo do get in contact with me through issues.
Also this project is still under work. Incase anyone wanna contribute with this you can open an issue and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
